The Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), is a long studied problem which consists of the solving for the optimal docking of vessels on a birth to be processed. There are many renditions of the problem to optimize over multiple quays, to be solved using discrete or continuous variables, to optimize over different parameters such as time of service or cost, and many more. Needless to say, it is a well studied problem. This post introduces that idea and then begins to introduce some new ideas and views that BAP may be used for.

Linear programming is a widely used method of solving for obtaining optimal solutions. They typically come in the form of some cost function \(\sum_i c_i x_i\) subject so some set of constraints. This solution method works extremely well when the problem and its constraints are well defined. Real life problems, however, are rarely well defined and are almost indefinitely left with some ambiguity or &ldquo;wiggle room&rdquo;. That is what this post is about, a way to represent linear programs with different types of fuzzy parameters.

I have been spending a lot of time as of late creating a small framework for developing games. It is in an extreme infancy still, but it has given me a lot of chances to practice and learn a lot of new techniques. One of the things I&rsquo;ve always known about that would be useful are callback methods, but I never really had the time to implement it up until today. The concept is not to difficult to understand (we will go into how it works later), but the actual application is a little more complicated. Not by much, but enough to give me a hard time for a few hours.
