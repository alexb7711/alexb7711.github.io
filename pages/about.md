## About This Blog
When I was a kid, my dad always told me the best way to start learning something is to first mimic what others do. Copy it, understand it, then try to expand on it. Which has been priceless advice going through college and work.

There have been so many new ideas and inspirations that I would never have thought of without a lot of the blog posts and videos that I have viewed. Not to mention the many frustrations mitigated through tutorials. This space is meant to share some of the thoughts and things I have learned in hopes that someone else may gain something in the same way I have.

This blog is the mind dump of everything I learn, here is a short list of what you can expect to find here (and on my YouTube Channel):
* Coding 
	* C/C++

	* Python
